# Generate questions in Arabic

## Abstract:
In this work, we build a question generation model based on machine learning and natural language processing. The project facilitates the learning and studying process for the student and also facilitates the process of setting questions for the teacher

 ### The questions we addressed in this work are four types:
  
  #### – Fact-based questions 
   
   ####  – Multiple choice questions
   
  #### – Fill in the blank questions
  
 ####  – True & False questions

The issue of question generation using deep learning is a relatively low-profile issue. There is still very little published research on it in the Arabic language.

## Dividing the methods for solving the problem into two main parts:
 ### The first: traditional rule-based approaches.
### Second: statistical methods such as machine learning and deep learning.

   In some cases, a combination of both methods may be used together. Each of these methods has its advantages and disadvantages

### Dataset :
#### ARCD (Arabic Reading Comprehension Dataset):
A collection of data in Arabic consisting of 1,395 questions on 465 items selected from 155 articles on the Arabic Wikipedia.

#### TyDi QA (Typologically Diverse Question Answering) :
In all of the other data collections mentioned here (including SQuAD), a person is asked to read a passage and then ask it a question (that is, the person chooses in his mind in advance a sentence as an answer and then poses a question to it).
QA TyDi is compiled in the opposite way: when a person types a question into a Google search box, Google then suggests a Wikipedia article and asks them to select the answer to the question from the article (i.e. the person does not already know the answer, so the questions in this dataset are often more natural and spontaneous )

### Evaluation metrics: ROUGE, METEOR, BLEU .

Fact-based questions :
